# Lab Report 4 Week 8

When creating and implementing tests, we want to have a definition for what success looks like, regardless of how our code is working. This definition is given to us by the [CommonMark demo site](https://spec.commonmark.org/dingus/) where we're going to see how our program *should* behave (in both implementations).

**What test for Snippet 1 *should* produce**

**What test for Snippet 2 *should* produce**

**What test for Snippet 3 *should* produce**

Since we have the same goal and definition of what success is in this program we added [the same] 3 test methods to each implementation (6 total test methods) in `MarkdownParseTest.java`.
